# Assignment1
Regarding the structure of the repository, we have the 6 files source code in one folder and the tester code in the other folder.
The UML diagram is in the home folder names Assign1.We have 7 files of code in one folder. The names of the files are ‘Apple.java’, 
‘AppleFactory.java’, ‘Banana.java’,‘BananaFactory.java’, ‘GroceryProduct.java’, GroceryProductFactory.java’, and ‘GroceryStore.java’.
These files are linked together to execute one output altogether. The test method that we developed is technically the 
‘GroceryStore.java’ file because all the information is pulled from that file itself. 

our output:
